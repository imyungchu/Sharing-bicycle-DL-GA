###  1. Motivation of this project ? Why few sharing bicycle system can success ?
The rising wave of the sharing economy in the world has prompted a large amount of capital and technology to be invested in the sharing bicycle system. Because bicycle sharing is **environmentally friendly** and can prevent traffic congestion, sharing bicycles are an effective choice to replace traditional high carbon emission transportation. In addition, sharing bicycles can **reduce the number of any possible risk of social contact** that mainly occur in public places, and this is especially important in today's severe COVID-19 pandemic. 

Under the **uncertainty of demand**, sharing bicycles system are prone to encounter **supply and demand unbalanced**, and the system also **lacks a good bicycle redistribution strategy**. As a result, there is almost no successful sharing bicycle system, and it has attracted many people ,including us, work on this topic.


### 2. What are the differents between our project and others?
Most of the previous studies considered simply station Demand Forecasting or sharing bicycle redistribution routing.Only considering the former is unable to actually adjust the number of sharing bicycles at the stations. While only consider the latter can optimize the route according to historical data, it cannot effectively cope with the changing demand for bicycles in real time and space. Therefore, this study **integrating Sharing Bicycle Redistribution Routing Problem with Station Demand Forecasting**. 

#### a. Studying methods
The demand forecasting of sharing bicycle stations is a **time series forecasting problem**, and sharing bicycle redistribution routing is a kind of **Vehicle Routing Problem with Pickup and Delivery (VRPPD)** which are NP-hard complex problems. Our study further proposes a **long short-term memory (LSTM)** and **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** ,and they are all Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models of deep learning. 

#### b. Studying procedures
Use the methods and models above to establish three prediction models to predict the demand for sharing bicycles at each station hourly in the future.And then the caculated and **predicted number of bicycles in and out of each station** is used as the input of the redistribution model to minimize carbon emissions and the total amount of redistribution distance.We establishes a Mathematical Programming for **reducing total distance and cost**, and finally uses the **Genetic Algorithm(GA)** to optimize sharing bicycle redistribution routing problem. 

### 3. How to implement and evaluate the idea of our project?
To evaluate the proposed method, this study work on some programming experience using the open dataset of [Capital Bikeshare](https://ride.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data), the largest bike-sharing system in the United States, located in Washington DC.  Quantitative historical data and attributes that affect demand are tested for a simulated experimental data set. 
#### Conclusion
The experiments confirm that our method proposed in this study, implementing with the **Keras** open source library, can **reduce 36% of the total distance** and carbon emissions, reaching the goal of energy saving, carbon reduction and **sustainable operation of the sharing bicycle system**.
```python=
# We use cross validation (Train data 70%,Testing data30%)
# The function cross validation

def build_training_and_validation_data(x_train, y_train, rate):
  X_train = x_train[int(x_train.shape[0]*rate):]
  Y_train = y_train[int(y_train.shape[0]*rate):]
  X_val = x_train[:int(x_train.shape[0]*rate)]
  Y_val = y_train[:int(y_train.shape[0]*rate)]
  return X_train, Y_train, X_val, Y_val

### Descriptioon 

The dataset of this project are downloaded from [Capital Bikeshare official website](https://ride.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data) (2018~2021)
There are two parts of our codes : 

1. Demand forcasting using Deep learning ( LSTM / GRU )
```python=

from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Activation, Flatten, LSTM, TimeDistributed, RepeatVector, GRU
from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  model = Sequential()
  model.add(LSTM(20, input_shape=(shape[1],shape[2]),return_sequences=True))
  model.add(LSTM(10, input_shape=(shape[1],shape[2]),return_sequences=False))
  model.add(Dropout(0.05))
  model.add(Dense(10))
  model.add(Dense(1))
  model.compile(loss="mse", optimizer="Adam", metrics=['accuracy', 'mse'])
  model.summary()

def fitFunc(x1, x2):
    vtotal = 0
    v_dist = np.zeros((NUM_VEHICLE,), dtype=float)
    pre_city = np.zeros((NUM_VEHICLE,), dtype=int)
    weight = np.full((NUM_VEHICLE,), INIT_WEIGHT)
    route = np.zeros([NUM_VEHICLE, NUM_POINT], dtype=int)
    
    for i in range(NUM_BIT):  # 站點分給每一台車
        j = np.argmin([math.hypot(location[x1[i]][0] - x2[2 * k], location[x1[i]][1] - x2[2 * k + 1]) for k in range(NUM_VEHICLE)])
        v_dist[j] += dist[pre_city[j]][x1[i]]
        pre_city[j] = x1[i]

        for a in range(NUM_POINT):      # 將站點記錄起來
            if route[j][a] == 0:
                route[j][a] = x1[i]
                break

    for i in range(NUM_VEHICLE):  # 加上回到起點的距離
        v_dist[i] += dist[pre_city[i]][0]

    for i in range(NUM_VEHICLE):
        for j in range(NUM_POINT):  #算即時載重
          if route[i][j] != 0:
            weight[i] = weight[i] + need[route[i][j] - 1]
            if weight[i] < 0 or weight[i] > MAX_WEIGHT:
              v_dist[i] = 100000
          else:
            break

    for i in range(NUM_VEHICLE):  # 算總距離
        vtotal += v_dist[i]


    return -(vtotal)  # 回傳總路徑長
